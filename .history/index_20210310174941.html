        The <strong>NVIDIA® GeForce®GTX 1060</strong> graphics card is a PCI Express 3.0 ×16 graphics card.
        Your computer may already have a graphics card installed in the PCI Express slot. If so,
        you will need to remove that graphics card and replace it with the GeForce GTX 1060
        graphics card.
        If you do not have a graphics card, <span>this means that your</span> motherboard has on-board
        graphics (there is a graphics chip installed on your motherboard or integrated in the
        motherboard chipset). If this is the case, there is no action that needs to be taken
        before installing your new graphics card.
